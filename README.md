# EditorDemo

This is only a showcase of a university project, a small proof of concept for an editor that allows users to create and manage digital exhibitions and plan room layouts. Build in TypeScript with Babylon.js, React.js and Bootstrap Icons.

## Project Description

The editor allows users to position, orient, and scale objects within a 3D space through a gizmo interface.

### Key Features

- **Context-Sensitive GUI**:
  - **Dynamic Controls**: The GUI adapts based on the selected gizmo mode and is anchored to the gizmo root's position on the screen
  - **Transformation Modes**: Switching between moving, rotating, and scaling objects
  - **Reference Space Options**: Changing reference space for transformations between world or local object space
  - **Scaling Options**: Scaling an object around its center or in a given direction
  - **Copy/Delete Objects**: Duplicate or remove selected objects
- **Undo Functionality**: Undo the last action through a button in the top left corner
- **Axis Indicators**: Tracking the translation gizmoâ€™s axis directions on the screen (functionality to be added)

### Current Status

This project is still in its setup phase; experimenting with GitHub Pages and slowly porting features of the main project over
